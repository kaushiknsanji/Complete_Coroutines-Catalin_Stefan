# First Time User Experience Setup: Coroutines and Room
In this Project, we build the **First Time User Experience (FTUE)** using **"Sign-Up"**, **"Login"** and **"Main"** Screens. Backend for user onboarding and authentication is implemented using **"Room Database"**, session management is done only in memory (_does not persist_) and the screens are navigated using **"Jetpack Navigation Component"**. One will learn-
* **How to do CRUD operations on database using Room**
* **How to use Coroutines with Room and MVVM**
* **How to navigate based on user data in the DB using Jetpack Navigation**

## Getting Started
Link to the source Starter Project is [here](https://github.com/DevTides/AndroidCoroutinesRoom). Can also be cloned from the [commit](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Complete_Coroutines-Catalin_Stefan/commit/3bdcbdd6d856bf05d99bcee3742b240b6eb069b0) of this project, in order to start with the initial state.

## Built With
* **[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)** and **[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)** Jetpack components for MVVM
* **[Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation)** for navigating between screens
* **[Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)** for Database
* **[Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx)** for idiomatic kotlin extensions on Jetpack components
* Kotlin **[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)** for background processing
